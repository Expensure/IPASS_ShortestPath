# IPASS_ShortestPath

Data is edited in get_data
be sure to make a CSV file with just x an y coordinates.

an appropriate csv should look like:

|x, y 

|5379,1274

|4289,4215

|42657,32621

ETC

Change the amount of clusters in Clustering, in case your CSV files are too large (>60)

Do that in get_clusters(_,6<--)
