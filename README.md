# IPASS_ShortestPath

Data is edited in get_data
be sure to make a CSV file with the city_id and the x and y coordinates.

an appropriate csv should look like:

|city_id, x, y 

|0, 5379,1274

|1, 4289,4215

|2, 42657,32621

ETC

Change the amount of clusters in Clustering, in case your CSV files are too large (>60)

Do that in get_clusters(_,6<--)
